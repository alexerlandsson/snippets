# Snippets

> Collection of useful html, css and js snippets.

This repository contains a collection of useful snippets and boilerplates for things I am using on a daily basis. Each subject has been studied in detail to be as precise and complete as possible.

As soon as I come across a small isolated problem that could easily be avoided, I will include the solution in this repository.
